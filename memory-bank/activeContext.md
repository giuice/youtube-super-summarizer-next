# Active Context:

**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the YouTube Super Summarizer project. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and team alignment.

## Current Work Focus:
1. Strategy planning for new features and database migration
2. Preparing for implementation of "Talk with Transcription" chat feature
3. Planning database migration from Supabase to Neon PostgreSQL
4. Organizing tasks for efficient execution

## Next Steps:
1. Begin execution of the chat feature implementation (see `memory-bank/strategy-tasks/chat_feature_instructions.md`)
   - Start with Chat UI Components creation
   - Set up domain model for chat services
2. Initiate database migration preparation (see `memory-bank/strategy-tasks/database_migration_instructions.md`)
   - Set up Neon PostgreSQL account and project
   - Design migration strategy with validation mechanisms
3. Prioritize between chat feature and database migration based on resource availability
4. Transition to Execution phase to implement planned features

## Task Prioritization:
1. **High Priority:** Chat feature UI components and basic functionality
2. **High Priority:** Neon PostgreSQL setup and connection testing
3. **Medium Priority:** Chat service implementation with language model integration
4. **Medium Priority:** Repository implementations for Neon PostgreSQL
5. **Medium Priority:** Data migration utilities
6. **Low Priority:** Advanced chat features (typing indicators, etc.)

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- CRCT system being used to manage project development and track dependencies
- Chat popup will only retain memory for the current conversation session
- Chat will use only the stored transcript and not generate new fetch requests
- Repository pattern allows for clean DB migration with minimal changes to domain logic
- Planning to maintain both Supabase and Neon implementations during transition
- No immediate UI redesign, but ShadCN is a future consideration
- No versioning decision yet, but update may be tagged as `v1.1`
- Code architecture follows domain-driven design with clean separation of concerns

## Recent CRCT System Updates:
- Transitioned from Set-up/Maintenance to Strategy phase
- Created instruction files for "Talk with Transcription" chat feature
- Created instruction files for database migration to Neon PostgreSQL
- Prioritized tasks and established execution order
