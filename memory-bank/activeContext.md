# Active Context

## Latest Actions
- Confirmed theme system (DaisyUI) is working correctly based on user feedback. Adjusted priorities accordingly.
- Migrated dependency tracking system to matrix format:
  - Implemented new dependency matrix with clear relationship symbols (>, <, x, -, d)
  - Unified component and theme system dependencies in single view
  - Enhanced visualization of mutual dependencies
  - Clarified relationships between UI components and theme system
- Fixed critical theme switching issue (prior action):
  - Resolved application freezing when changing themes
  - Simplified theme application logic to prevent infinite loops
  - Removed problematic MutationObserver causing circular references
  - Added guard conditions to prevent recursive theme application
  - Streamlined ThemeToggle component implementation

## Reasoning
- User confirmed theme system is stable; previous bug report was outdated.
- Matrix-based dependency system provides clearer visualization of relationships.
- Mutual dependencies (x) now explicitly shown between theme components.
- Theme freezing (prior issue) was caused by recursive theme application creating infinite loops.
- Simplified theme switching provides better reliability and performance.
- Event-based approach replaced with direct state management for stability.
- Guard flags prevent cascading theme updates that could lock the UI.
- Consistent use of Shadcn UI components improves maintainability.
- Modern styling patterns enhance user experience and accessibility.
- Component structure follows single responsibility principle.
- Error handling and loading states provide better user feedback.
- File organization maintains clear separation of concerns.

## Next Steps (Updated Priorities)
1.  **[HIGH] Implement semantic search for transcript content in chat**
2.  [HIGH] Continue verifying theme consistency across remaining components
3.  [MEDIUM] Enhance chat experience with typing indicators and history persistence
4.  Monitor database performance in production
5.  Update unit tests to reflect component structure changes
6.  Document new component patterns for team reference
7.  Review accessibility improvements
8.  Consider performance optimizations

## Dependencies
Updated to matrix-based system in dependency_tracker.md:
- Clear visualization of component dependencies
- Explicit mutual dependencies between theme components
- Direct and inverse relationships shown with > and < symbols
- Documentation dependencies marked with 'd'

## Status
Phase: Execution
Progress: Priorities updated based on user feedback. Ready for next task.
Next Phase: Strategy (after current execution tasks)
