# Active Context:

**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the LLMRPG project. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and team alignment.


## Current Work Focus:
1. Implement "Talk with Transcription" chat feature.
2. Migrate database from Supabase to Neon PostgreSQL.
3. Ensure seamless integration of Neon PostgreSQL with the existing app.

## Next Steps:
1. Set up Neon PostgreSQL database and migrate data.
2. Implement chat popup above the summarized section.
3. Connect chat feature to OpenAI/DeepSeek.
4. Test chat featureâ€™s interaction with saved transcripts.
5. Update API endpoints to reflect database changes.
6. Validate data persistence and retrieval from Neon PostgreSQL.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Chat popup will only retain memory for the current conversation session.
- Chat will use only the stored transcript and not generate new fetch requests.
- No immediate UI redesign, but ShadCN is a future consideration.
- No versioning decision yet, but update may be tagged as `v1.1`.
