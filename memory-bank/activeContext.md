# Active Context

## Latest Actions
- Identified new theme toggle bug:
  - The ThemeToggle component is visible, but clicking on theme options has no effect
  - Theme selection appears to be properly registered but visual changes are not applied
  - Previous fix for application freezing resolved the initial issue but introduced this new bug
  - Will require investigation of theme application mechanism in ThemeProvider and ThemeToggle
- Fixed critical theme switching issue:
  - Resolved application freezing when changing themes
  - Simplified theme application logic to prevent infinite loops
  - Removed problematic MutationObserver causing circular references
  - Added guard conditions to prevent recursive theme application
  - Streamlined ThemeToggle component implementation
- Completed component migration phase:
  - Enhanced ChatPopup with Shadcn UI for better UX and theme consistency
  - Migrated SummaryItem and SummaryList to use Card components
  - Updated VideoTitleList with modern grid layout and responsive design
  - Improved SummaryChapters components with consistent styling
  - Implemented DocumentSummarizer with file upload and text input
  - Enhanced VideoSummarizer with loading states and error handling
  - Added textarea component to ui components collection

## Reasoning
- Theme toggle bug likely caused by disconnection between theme selection and application mechanism
- Simplification of previous theme application code may have removed essential functionality
- Need to re-establish proper connection between theme selection and CSS variable application
- Theme freezing was caused by recursive theme application creating infinite loops
- Simplified theme switching provides better reliability and performance
- Event-based approach replaced with direct state management for stability
- Guard flags prevent cascading theme updates that could lock the UI
- Consistent use of Shadcn UI components improves maintainability
- Modern styling patterns enhance user experience and accessibility
- Component structure follows single responsibility principle
- Error handling and loading states provide better user feedback
- File organization maintains clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps
1. Verify component integration with existing functionality
2. Update unit tests to reflect new component structure
3. Document new component patterns for team reference
4. Review accessibility improvements
5. Consider performance optimizations

## Dependencies
- Added UI dependencies:
  - SummaryItem -> Card, CardContent
  - VideoTitleList -> Input, Card
  - DocumentSummarizer -> Textarea, Card
  - VideoSummarizer -> Card, Button

## Status
Phase: Component Migration
Progress: Core components migrated to Shadcn UI
Next Phase: Testing and Documentation
