# Active Context:

**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the YouTube Super Summarizer project. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and team alignment.

## Current Work Focus:
1. Implementation of database migration components for Neon PostgreSQL
2. Preparing to run schema setup and data migration
3. Transitioning from Strategy to Execution phase for database migration
4. Planning "Talk with Transcription" chat feature implementation

## Next Steps:
1. Run the Neon PostgreSQL setup and migration:
   - Set up Neon PostgreSQL account and obtain connection string
   - Configure environment variables (`NEON_CONNECTION_STRING`, `ACTIVE_DATABASE`)
   - Run SchemaSetup to create database tables
   - Execute MigrationUtility to transfer data from Supabase
   - Validate data integrity after migration
   - Test application functionality with Neon PostgreSQL

2. Complete chat feature implementation (see `memory-bank/strategy-tasks/chat_feature_instructions.md`)
   - Start with Chat UI Components creation
   - Set up domain model for chat services

## Task Prioritization:
1. **High Priority:** Neon PostgreSQL account setup and connection testing
2. **High Priority:** Running SchemaSetup and database migration
3. **High Priority:** Testing application with Neon PostgreSQL database
4. **Medium Priority:** Chat feature UI components and basic functionality
5. **Medium Priority:** Chat service implementation with language model integration
6. **Low Priority:** Advanced chat features (typing indicators, etc.)

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Using RepositoryFactory pattern to seamlessly switch between Supabase and Neon implementations
- Environment variables will control which database is active (`ACTIVE_DATABASE=supabase|neon`)
- Both Supabase and Neon implementations will coexist during transition period
- Repository interfaces remain unchanged thanks to dependency injection design
- Migration process includes data validation to ensure integrity
- Code architecture follows domain-driven design with clean separation of concerns

## Recent Development Updates:
- Implemented NeonPostgres connection management
- Created repository implementations for all domain entities (Video, Transcript, Summary, VideoSegment)
- Developed MigrationUtility for data transfer from Supabase to Neon
- Created SchemaSetup utility for database table creation
- Implemented RepositoryFactory for dynamic repository selection
- Fixed missing create method in VideoSegmentRepositoryNeon
- Updated VideoDataService to use RepositoryFactory instead of direct instantiation
