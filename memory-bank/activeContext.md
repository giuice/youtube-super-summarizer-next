# Active Context:

**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the YouTube Super Summarizer project. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and team alignment.

## Current Work Focus:
1. Enhancing chat feature functionality
2. System stability and performance optimization
3. User experience improvements

## Next Steps:
1. Add typing indicators to chat UI (optional enhancement)
2. Consider implementing chat history persistence
3. Monitor Neon PostgreSQL performance in production

## Task Prioritization:
1. **Medium Priority:** Chat feature UI enhancements (typing indicators)
2. **Medium Priority:** Chat history persistence implementation
3. **Low Priority:** Performance monitoring and optimization

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Successfully migrated to Neon PostgreSQL as primary database
- Using RepositoryFactory pattern for database access
- Environment variables properly configured for production use
- Repository interfaces remain unchanged thanks to dependency injection design
- Code architecture follows domain-driven design with clean separation of concerns

## Recent Development Updates:
- Completed database migration to Neon PostgreSQL
- Implemented chat feature with UI components and backend integration
- Validated data integrity after migration
- All integration tests passing with new database
- Fixed client-side repository access issues
