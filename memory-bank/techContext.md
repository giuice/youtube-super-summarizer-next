# Technical Context:

## Technologies Used:

## Development Setup:

*   **Operating System:**
*   **Python Version:**
*   **Virtual Environment:**
*   **API Keys:** Securely manage API keys (e.g., Gemini API key) using environment variables.

## Technical Constraints:

*   **LLM Context Window:** LLMs have a limited context window, requiring careful management of the amount of information passed to and from the LLM.
*   **API Rate Limits:**  APIs may have rate limits, which could impact performance.
*   **Computational Resources:**  Running LLMs and managing large datasets can be computationally intensive.

## Dependencies:

*(This list will be updated as the project evolves.)*
