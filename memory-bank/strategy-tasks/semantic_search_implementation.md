# Semantic Search Implementation for Transcript Chat Instructions

## Objective
Implement semantic search capabilities for transcript content to enable more intelligent and context-aware chat interactions using LangChain or similar vector search technologies.

## Context
The application currently has a chat feature but lacks semantic search capabilities for video transcripts. Adding this feature will allow users to receive more relevant responses by enabling the system to search for semantically similar content in transcripts rather than relying on exact keyword matches.

## Dependencies
- domain/chat/ChatService.ts
- domain/transcript/TranscriptService.ts
- domain/transcript/Transcript.ts
- infra/neon/TranscriptRepositoryNeon.ts
- domain/model/BaseLanguageModel.ts

## Steps
1. âœ… **Research Vector Database Options**
   - Evaluate LangChain's vector store capabilities
   - Consider alternatives: Pinecone, Weaviate, or pgvector with Neon
   - Document decision criteria including performance, ease of integration, and cost

2. **Set Up Vector Store**
   - Create vector embeddings integration class in `infra/vectorstore/`
   - Implement connection and configuration for chosen vector database
   - Create utility functions for embedding generation

3. **Modify Transcript Processing**
   - Update `TranscriptService.ts` to generate embeddings when processing transcripts
   - Create chunking logic to split transcripts into optimal segments for vector storage
   - Add metadata attachment to transcript chunks (video ID, timestamp, etc.)

4. **Implement Search Service**
   - Create `domain/search/SemanticSearchService.ts`
   - Implement similarity search methods with relevance scoring
   - Add context window assembly from retrieved chunks

5. **Integrate with Chat Service**
   - Modify `ChatService.ts` to leverage the semantic search
   - Implement prompt engineering to include retrieved context
   - Create fallback mechanisms when semantic search yields low confidence results

6. **Create Testing Harness**
   - Develop test cases for semantic search quality
   - Implement evaluation metrics for search relevance
   - Create benchmark suite for performance testing

## Expected Output
- Functional semantic search implementation for transcript content
- Enhanced chat responses that leverage transcript context
- Performance metrics for search latency and relevance
- Documentation of vector store implementation and configuration

## Notes
- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed embeddings
- Balance chunk size for optimal semantic search quality
- Include clear error handling for cases where the vector database is unavailable
- Evaluate privacy implications of storing vector embeddings
- Consider implementing hybrid search (semantic + keyword) for optimal results
