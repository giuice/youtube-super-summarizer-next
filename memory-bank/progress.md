# Progress:

## What's Left to Build:
1. Chat popup UI implementation.
2. API logic to handle chat interactions.
3. Database migration and validation.

## Immediate Priorities:
1. Fix front-end chat popup. the interace not using the same style of the site, also the popup not opening as popup but a div bellow summary.
2. Connect chat feature to stored transcripts, maybe using some tool to make a sematic search on text based on user ask and let ai answer.
3. Neondb accept vectorized or semantic search data? 
## Known Issues:
- Supabase freezes data after 5 days of inactivity.
- Potential performance impact during migration process.
