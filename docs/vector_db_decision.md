# Vector Database Decision for Semantic Search

## Objective
Select the most suitable vector database solution for implementing semantic search on video transcripts within the YouTube Super Summarizer project.

## Options Considered
1.  **`pgvector` with Supabase/Neon:** Leveraging existing PostgreSQL infrastructure.
2.  **Dedicated Vector DB (e.g., Pinecone):** Purpose-built vector database service.
3.  **Other LangChain In-Memory/File Stores (e.g., FAISS, Chroma):** Simpler, less persistent options.

## Decision Criteria
-   **Performance:** Search speed, indexing time, scalability under load.
-   **Ease of Integration:** Compatibility with Next.js, LangChain, Supabase/Neon; setup complexity.
-   **Scalability:** Ability to handle growing numbers of transcripts and vectors.
-   **Maintenance Overhead:** Operational burden, updates, backups.
-   **Cost:** Infrastructure costs, service fees, potential free tiers.

## Research Findings

### 1. `pgvector` with Supabase/Neon
-   **Pros:**
    -   Leverages existing Supabase/Neon PostgreSQL database, simplifying infrastructure management.
    -   Potentially lower cost compared to dedicated services if included in current plan.
    -   Unified data management (relational data + vectors).
    -   Confirmed available and preferred for this project.
    -   Good LangChain integration (`langchain/community/vectorstores/pgvector`).
-   **Cons:**
    -   Performance might be lower than highly optimized dedicated vector DBs at extreme scale.
    -   Requires enabling and managing the extension within PostgreSQL.
-   **Integration Notes:**
    -   Requires enabling the `vector` extension in the Supabase/Neon database.
    -   Need appropriate connection details for LangChain integration.
-   **Cost:**
    -   Likely included within existing Supabase/Neon resource limits/costs (needs verification based on usage).

### 2. Dedicated Vector DB (e.g., Pinecone)
-   **Pros:**
    -   Highly optimized for vector search performance and scalability.
    -   Managed service reduces operational overhead.
-   **Cons:**
    -   Introduces an additional external service dependency and potential cost.
    -   Requires separate data synchronization if relational data is needed alongside vectors.
-   **Integration Notes:**
    -   Requires Pinecone API keys and client setup.
-   **Cost:**
    -   Has free tiers, but production usage likely incurs costs based on index size/usage.

### 3. Other LangChain Stores (FAISS, Chroma)
-   **Pros:**
    -   Very simple setup for local development or small-scale testing.
-   **Cons:**
    -   Generally not suitable for production due to persistence and scalability limitations.

## Decision
**Chosen Solution:** **`pgvector` with Supabase/Neon**

**Rationale:**
-   **User Confirmation:** Confirmed as available and the preferred approach for this project.
-   **Integration:** Leverages the existing Supabase/Neon infrastructure, minimizing complexity and avoiding an additional external service.
-   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Likely more cost-effective by utilizing the current database resources.
-   **Unified Data:** Keeps relational transcript metadata and vector embeddings within the same system.
-   **Sufficient Performance:** Expected to provide adequate performance for the project's current scale.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with Step 2: Set Up Vector Store using `pgvector` with Supabase/Neon.
